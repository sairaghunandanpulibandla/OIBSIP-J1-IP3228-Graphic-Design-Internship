This repository is created to submit my allocated Graphic design Tasks #oasis Infobyte #Graphic Design


Welcome to the Oasis Infobyte Graphic Design Projects repository. This repository contains projects, including "TASK-1-Posters And Fliers, TASK-2-Logo, TASK-3-Bussiness Card, TASK-4-Infographics, TASK-5-Magazines and Brochures." These projects are designed to help you improve your Graphic Design skills and showcase your knowledge.


## TASK-1: `Posters And Fliers`
The first project I worked on was posters and Fliers. This project allowed me to explore the world of Designing and learn how to create a user-friendly interface for a Poster.

## TASK 2: `Logo'
The second project I worked on was a Logo. While this project was relatively simple, it helped me develop my logic and Design skills.

## TASK 3: `Bussiness Card`
The third Project I worked on was Bussiness Card. This project was the most challenging of the five, as it required me to develop two pages of design that emulated the functionalities of a Bussiness Card.
I had to implement features such as displaying a menu of options, prompting the user for input, and updating account balances based on the user's actions. This project helped me develop my skills in Java programming, especially in working with classes, objects, and methods.
